# CoopGroup Website

This is the repository that contains all of the code we used to make our website. We used Jekyll to build it, and GitHub to host it.

There will be push updates from this repo sent to the #github channel in our discord. (go join at [coopgroup.org](https://coopgroup.org))
## Files
`_config.yml` - general configuration file

`index.html` - content of the homepage (that's not in the default layout)

`404.html` - the 404 page

`CNAME` - the CNAME DNS record for our domain

`Gemfile` -  the dependencies

`Gemfile.lock` - useless to you and me

`README.md` the file you are reading right now.

`LICENSE.md` - We license our code under the GPL v3

## File Tree
`/assets` - assets like images, and videos, but also our javascript and SCSS.

`/_pages` - pages besides the homepage

`/_layouts` - layouts of different pages

`/_includes` - reuseable components

`/_sass` - don't touch scss (unless you know what you're doing, unlike us :) )


##### We used the [Memoirs Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/memoirs-jekyll-theme) by @wowthemesnet on github. Very nice theme, easy to work with.
