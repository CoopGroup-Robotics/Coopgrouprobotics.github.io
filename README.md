# CoopGroup Website

This is the repository that contains all of the code we used to make our website. We used Jekyll to build it, and GitHub to host it.

## Files
`_config.yml` - general configuration file
`index.html` - content of the homepage (that's not in the default layout)
`404.html` - the 404 page
`CNAME` - the CNAME DNS record for our domain
`Gemfile` -  the dependencies
`Gemfile.lock` - useless to you and me
`README.md` the file you are reading right now.
`

## File Tree
`/assets` - assets like images, and videos, but also our javascript and SCSS.
`/_pages` - pages besides the homepage
`/_layouts` - layouts of different pages
`/_includes` - reuseable components
`/_sass` - don't touch scss (unless you know what you're doing, unlike us :) )
`/site` - generated html/css/js


##### We used the [Memoirs Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/memoirs-jekyll-theme) by @wowthemesnet on github. Very nice theme, easy to work with.
