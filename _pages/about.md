CoopGroup is a coding club based in Austin, TX that aims to help kids take the next step in coding. Most coding courses for kids teach them with blocks. That doesn't work because it doesn't give an accurate picture of what coding is. We at CoopGroup teach them coding languages, like Python and HTML5. Teaching languages instead of blocks gives them a picture of what coding really is and teaches them real skills, unlike block coding. Also, we're free! No charge to come! So come join CoopGroup and take the next step in coding.
